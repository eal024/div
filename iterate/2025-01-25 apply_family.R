# The base functional functions
# Based on this blog: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2025/01/r-for-seo-part-8-apply-methods-in-r/

# Apply: Apply runs across a column in a matrix or dataframe. I generally use this when I want to find the maximum or minimum value of a column or if I’m trying to find the number of times a term is mentioned in a text corpus
# Lapply: Applies a function across a list or vector and is great for using functions and API calls
# Sapply: Similar to lapply. Sapply means “simple apply” and tries to simplify the output compared to lapply
# Mapply: Mapply means “map apply” and is great when you need to use your apply method across multiple datasets or elements
